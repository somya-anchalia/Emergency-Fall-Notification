# Emergency-Fall-Notification
Emergency Fall Notification System is an application of IoT domain. It is a wearable device that helps to detect fall of a person. For elderly, detection of fall is one of the most common problems as they are less fit physically. Due to weakness or dizziness, many old people can suffer from accidental falls. Since old people are weak, these type of accidents may have severe effects, if help is not given in time. Studies show that the most of the serious problems are not due to the result of falling, but rather due to late medical help. Post fall issues can be significantly reduced if caretakers can be notified in time. The proposed system includes an accelerometer and gyroscope sensors for sensing the linear acceleration along with the orientation, a GPS sensor for detecting location, a micro-controller, a WiFi module and a battery. The sensor provides accelerations of elderly body movements to the microcontroller which identifies a fall, collect location coordinates of the person with the help of GPS and triggers the WiFi module that sends a notification to the caretakers along with the location. The WiFi module will be in the sleep mode until here is a fall which makes the system more energy efficient. We use parameter threshold in our proposed fall detection as a method to detect falls which is an accurate method.
